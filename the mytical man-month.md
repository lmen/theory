# The mytical man-month

*The mytical man-month: Essays on Software engineering* is a book writtem by Fred Brooks in 1975. 

The main theory of this book is "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later" and does not make the development faster.
This conclusion was drawn during the development of OS/360 operating system. He watched as the project was behind scheduling, the addition of more developments to the project added more delay to the project. 

For him, complex programming projects cannot be partitioned into discrete tasks where each task can be performed independadly from each other nor can be performed by a unique persone. A group of people must commmunicate with each other to performe a task. Also each member has its own initialy understanding of problem and technical background, so each member must be trained to understand the task and the team way of doing stuff.

To do one task is necessary to take in consideration not only the time for developining it but also the time involved in communication betwen the team members. Brooks poins out that, as the number of developers increases, so the communication time. He proposed a formula for calculating  the communication channels of a team with N members: N(N-1)/2.

When a new member is added to an existing project is necessary to take in condideration the impact it will have to the work progress on the others group members and not thinking naively the extra member will add a pure man-month of working power to the project, on the contrary, the new member will not give by itself a pure man-month of working power because its time will be divided by:
* doing technical tasks 
* communicating with other members of the team
* training activities

Not only the new member will not give a 100% man-month also some team members will also not give a 100% man-month because they have also extra work:
* train the new member 
* communicate with other members of the team and with the new member 

Of course for this discution is not taken into consideration the usally difficulties attached to each techinical task, mainly the time taken to develop.

# No silver bullet

Brooks has done a second edition to the *The mytical man-month* in 1995 where he reafirms that he has found out in 1974 and adds no single methodology will ever increase the efficiancy, due to the way tasks depend on each other and has the sofware projects become more complex more people are needed to develop, increasing the communication channels and the time overhead associated with those communication.
